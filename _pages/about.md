I am now a second-year Master student of [ZJUNLP](https://github.com/zjunlp) majored in Computer Science and Technology at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), advised by [Huajun Chen (陈华钧)](https://person.zju.edu.cn/huajun) and [Ningyu Zhang (张宁豫)](https://person.zju.edu.cn/ningyu). Previously, I graduated from the [College of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.en.cs.zju.edu.cn/), Zhejiang University (浙江大学计算机科学与技术学院) with a bachelor’s degree.

My research interests focus on Large Language Models (LLMs) and their theory and applications. I am interested in the Mechanism Interpretability of LLMs, and I am particularly interested in the application of LLMs to Autonomous Agents.
