I am now a second-year Master student of [ZJUNLP](https://github.com/zjunlp) majored in Computer Science and Technology at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), advised by [Huajun Chen (陈华钧)](https://person.zju.edu.cn/huajun) and [Ningyu Zhang (张宁豫)](https://person.zju.edu.cn/ningyu). Previously, I graduated from the [College of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.en.cs.zju.edu.cn/), Zhejiang University (浙江大学计算机科学与技术学院) with a bachelor’s degree.

My current research interests focus on Large Language Models (LLMs) and their theory and applications. I'm interested in the Mechanism Interpretability of LLMs and the application of LLMs to Autonomous Agents. I have published 5+ papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QVTr5dQAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Citations-{{ site.data.citations.author.citedby }}-4285F4?logo=googlescholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&style=flat"></a> at the top international AI conferences such as ACL and NAACL.

<b><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">I will graduate in the spring of 2026 and I'm seeking a job position as a researcher or engineer of LLM algorithm.</span></b>
